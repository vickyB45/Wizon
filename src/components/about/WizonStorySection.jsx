          We started Wizon Media after launching — and shutting down — 3 of our own ventures. Every time, the products were good, the teams were dedicated, but marketing broke everything.
        </p>
        <p className="text-end">
          We wasted money on the wrong campaigns. Listened to generic advice. Worked with freelancers who didn’t care. And when the numbers didn’t add up — no one told us why.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s when we realized: if we’re struggling with this, hundreds of other founders are too. So we decided to build what we wished we had back then — an agency that doesn’t just “run ads”… but helps scale a brand like a co-pilot.
